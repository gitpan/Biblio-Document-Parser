Installing Biblio::Document::Parser
============================

The easiest way to do this is like so:

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build install

You can also optionally run './Build test', which will run a few checks on
the modules.

Requirements
============

The following modules are required for Biblio::Document::Parser to function correctly:

- LWP::Simple, LWP::UserAgent (provided by libwww-perl)
- HTML::HeadParser (provided by the HTML-Parser package)
- File::Temp

You may also need MIME::Base64, HTML::TagSet, and Digest::MD5.

The most recent versions of these are located at http://www.cpan.org.
